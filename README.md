Problem Statement:

You are tasked with developing a graphical user interface (GUI) library that can be used across various platforms. The library should support creating components such as buttons, checkboxes, and text fields. Each component type should have platform-specific implementations to ensure a native look and feel on different operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).

Design a solution using the Abstract Factory pattern to address the following requirements:

Define an abstract factory interface that declares methods for creating different types of GUI components, such as Button, Checkbox, and TextField.
Create concrete factories for each supported platform (e.g., WindowsFactory, MacOSFactory, LinuxFactory). Each factory should implement the abstract factory interface and provide platform-specific implementations for creating GUI components.
Implement concrete classes for GUI components (e.g., WindowsButton, MacOSButton, LinuxButton) that inherit from a common interface (e.g., Button).
Ensure that the client code can create GUI components through the abstract factory without specifying their concrete classes or platform-specific details.
Allow for the addition of new component types or support for additional platforms without modifying existing client code.
Demonstrate how the Abstract Factory pattern helps achieve a family of related or dependent objects with consistent interfaces across different platforms.
Consider the following aspects in your design:

How to structure the abstract factory interface and its concrete implementations.
How to organize the component interfaces and their concrete implementations for different platforms.
How to ensure that the client code remains agnostic to the specific classes or platform details of the created GUI components.
Your solution should showcase the benefits of using the Abstract Factory pattern in terms of creating families of related objects while allowing flexibility for future extensions and changes in platform support.
